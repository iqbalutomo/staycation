## C. Adjusted Integrity Constraints:
- The `email` in the `users` entity must be unique.
- All attributes must be non-null (`NOT NULL`).
- Foreign keys (FK) in related entities such as `hotel_id`, `room_type_id`, `room_id`, `user_id`, `booking_id`, and `invoice_id` must reference valid primary keys.

---

## D. Adjusted Additional Notes:
- The system allows hotel owners to define different types of rooms with specific bed configurations and facilities.
- Customers can book rooms, and their bookings generate invoices that can be paid through various methods.
- The system also allows tracking of room availability based on bookings and other statuses like maintenance.

## 1NF (First Normal Form):
- Each column must contain atomic values, and each entity must have a primary key.
- This is fulfilled since all attributes are atomic, and each entity has a primary key.

## 2NF (Second Normal Form):
- The entity must be in 1NF, and all non-prime attributes must fully depend on the primary key.
- All entities are in 1NF.
- All non-prime attributes in each entity fully depend on the primary key.

## 3NF (Third Normal Form):
- The entity must be in 2NF, and there must be no transitive dependency of non-prime attributes on the primary key.
- All entities are in 2NF.
- There are no transitive dependencies in these entities, as all non-prime attributes directly depend on the primary key.
